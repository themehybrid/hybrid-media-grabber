# Hybrid\\Media\\Grabber

Hybrid Media Grabber is a script for pulling media either from the post content or attached to the post. It's an attempt to consolidate the various methods that users have used over the years to embed media into their posts. This script was written so that theme developers could grab that media and use it in interesting ways within their themes. For example, a theme could get a video and display it on archive pages alongside the post excerpt or pull it out of the content to display it above the post on single post views.
